        <h5><em>Palmer Doggie Depot (PDD) is a free neighborhood amenity for all dogs and their owners.
</em></h5>

<h5>Doggie Depot Background</h5>
<p>Our dog park was built by New Kensington Community Development Corporation (NKCDC) as a part of a larger project to make improvements to the Shissler Recreation Center. Both Shissler and the new Kensington CAPA High School form what NKCDC has dubbed the “Big Green Block”, or the block bounded by Palmer, Front, Norris, and Blair Streets. NKCDC has done amazing work with the city and nonprofit partners to not only improve the Rec Center and build the dog park, but also to construct innovative rain gardens and underground water infrastructure to help the Water Department manage storm water better in our area.
</p>

<h5>Our Board
</h5>
<p>In December 2013, NKCDC helped organize a resident group of people to form a board of directors for the dog park. We are a group of unpaid volunteers, and have gone through many growing pains in the past year, including losing several board members to the obstacles and busy schedules of everyday life. We are currently a board of 15 members: Erica Cissne, Colin Cissne, Amy Gallagher, Mary Elise Griffis (Secretary), Jack Inacker, Michael Kerns, Jess Kulik, Brian McKenna, Emily McKenna, Susan Murphy, Jennifer Nelson (President), Kelly Pomroy, Stephen Saxton, Evan Schlesinger, and Mindy Yablonski.

<p>Behind the scenes a dedicated band of volunteers, made up of Fishtown and Kensington residents, is working steadily to make PDD even better.</p>


<p><em>UPDATE: As of September 2014 the PDD is an IRS-certified 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit organization.
