            PDD is sustained solely by individual donations and grants. We
            receive no funding from the City’s Parks Department; instead we rely
            on the support of the Depot’s everyday users. To date we’ve raised
            sufficient resources to remove the park’s remaining asphalt and
            arrange for the majority of its disposal. Future planned
            improvements include a doggie water fountain, shading, and
            landscaping – but we need your help for these items!

              and play in a safe environment with other dogs.

              We will be scheduling park clean-ups where we tidy up the park
              itself and the surrounding area, and as we complete plans for more
              improvements will be announcing other volunteer projects via
              upcoming newsletters.

              There are many projects in the works to make Palmer Doggie Depot
              the best park possible for our four-legged friends, and all are
              more possible through community support.
